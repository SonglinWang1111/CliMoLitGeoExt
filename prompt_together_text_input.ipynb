    "Powered by theoretical advancement, big data and computer hardware, recent advances in autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to generate and understand complex human-like language. Yet, these models are typically trained on general corpora and usually struggle with domains like geography, which is inherently local, contextual, and interdisciplinary, shaped by diverse social, environmental, and political processes. (Janowicz et al., 2025). On the other hand, via proper and systematic prompts, including providing a few examples regarding the domain specific tasks, giving LLMs time to conduct chain-of-thought thinking, being task explicit etc., it has been proved that they can generally adapt to such tasks well (OpenAI, 2022; Bhandari et al., 2023; Majic et al., 2024). In this experiment, I use several popular LLMs to extract knowledge from unstructured climate mobility literature, on the one hand to apply them as advances in NLP to efficiently and precisely conduct downstream tasks, including literature review and domain specific graph foundation model construction for reliable, transparent and explainable retrieval and reasoning, and on the other hand as AI benchmarking, to demonstrate how domain-specific, knowledge-rich contexts can be understood better by AI, and test their geo-alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, I take the review paper from Borderon et al., 2019 and their coding system as ground truth, to benchmark 3 different LLMs, with 0-shot and 3-shot learning, as well as different temperatures. For each task I run 20 times for the comparison of accuracy."
